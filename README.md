# Memory Game Project


## The Project

This is my Udacity web-development nanodgree project. The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I'd completed the javascript code and made the app responsive with css.


## The Game has:
- Timer
- Star Rating
- Move Counter
- Congratulations Popup
